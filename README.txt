Together in person, both members discussed and worked out the strategy that they wanted to use, writing up pseudocode on a whiteboard. They started directly with the strategy using the minimax decision tree. This was thought through using a heuristic, in which they planned on giving point values to potential moves trrying to maximize the minimum gain. Both members initially did commits of smaller significance. After, Ruoyun used the pseudocode to code the strategy in C++.
